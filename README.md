# Car Booking Website

## Description

This PHP-based web application allows users to browse and book rental cars. It uses JSON files for data storage instead of a traditional database. Users can register, log in, and book cars for specific time periods. Administrators have the ability to manage car listings and view all bookings.

## Features

### Guest Users
- Browse available cars without logging in.
- View car details including images, brand, type, passenger capacity, transmission type, and daily price.
- Apply filters to search for cars based on:
  - Availability within a specific time range.
  - Transmission type (Automatic/Manual).
  - Passenger capacity.
  - Daily rental price.

### Registered Users
- Register and log in to book cars.
- Book a car for a specified time period.
- View their own past bookings (feature in development).
- Log out securely.

### Administrator Functions
- Log in with a dedicated admin account.
- Add new cars to the listing.
- Edit existing car details.
- Delete cars (removing related bookings as well).
- View all bookings made by users.
